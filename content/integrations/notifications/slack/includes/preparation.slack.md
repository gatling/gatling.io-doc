Notifications are based on webhooks, so you will have to configure one before using it in Gatling Cloud.

Follow [the official Slack documentation](https://api.slack.com/messaging/webhooks) to create one targeting the channel on which you want your notifications.

Keep your new webhook URL for the next step. It will be a URL that looks like the following:

```
https://hooks.slack.com/services/T00000000/B00000000/XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
```
