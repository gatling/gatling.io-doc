Microsoft Teams notifications are based on Microsoft Teams webhooks, so you will have to configure one before using it in Gatling Cloud.

Follow [the official Microsoft Teams documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoftteams/platform/webhooks-and-connectors/how-to/add-incoming-webhook#create-incoming-webhooks-1) to create one targeting the channel on which you want your notifications.

Keep your new webhook URL for the next step. It will be a URL that looks like the following:

```
https://xxxxx.webhook.office.com/xxxxxxxxx
```
