{{< alert warning >}}
This guide is intended for Gatling versions `{{< var gatlingVersion >}}` and later.
{{< /alert >}}

Gatling is a highly flexible load-testing platform. You can write load tests in Java, Kotlin, and Scala or use our [no-code feature](https://gatling.io/features/no-code-generator/) with Gatling Enterprise. In this guide, we cover a "Hello world"-style example of how to:

- [install and setup your local dev environment]({{< ref "#install-gatling" >}}),
- [write your first simulation]({{< ref "#simulation-construction" >}}),
- [run a simulation on Gatling Enterprise Cloud]({{< ref "#run-the-simulation-on-gatling-enterprise-cloud" >}}),
- [run the simulation locally for debugging]({{< ref "#run-the-simulation-locally-for-debugging" >}}).

## Setup

This section guides you through installation and setting up your developer environment. Gatling has a lot of optionalities, including:

- build tools,
- CI/CD integrations,
- Java, Kotlin, and Scala SDKs

This guide uses the Java SDK with the Maven wrapper. Gatling recommends that developers use the Java SDK unless they are already experienced with Scala or Kotlin. Java is widely taught in CS courses, requires less CPU for compiling, and is easier to configure in Maven and Gradle. You can adapt the steps to your development environment using reference documentation links provided throughout the guide.

### Sign up for Gatling Enterprise Cloud

Gatling Enterprise Cloud is a fully managed SaaS solution for load testing. Sign up for a [trial account](https://auth.gatling.io/auth/realms/gatling/protocol/openid-connect/registrations?client_id=gatling-enterprise-cloud-public&response_type=code&scope=openid&redirect_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fcloud.gatling.io%2Fr%2Fgatling) to run your first test on Gatling Enterprise Cloud. The [Gatling website](https://gatling.io/features) has a full list of Enterprise features.

### Clone Gatling demo repository { #install-gatling }

{{< alert info >}}
**Prerequisites**  
Java 11, 17, or 21 64-bit OpenJDK LTS (Long Term Support) version installed on your local machine. We recommend the [Azul JDK](https://www.azul.com/downloads/?package=jdk#zulu).
{{< /alert >}}

This guide uses the Gatling Java SDK with Maven. Use the following procedure to install Gatling:

1. Clone the following [repository](https://github.com/gatling/se-ecommerce-demo-gatling-tests).

2. Open the project in your IDE or terminal.
3. Navigate to the `/java` folder.

## Simulation construction

This guide introduces the basic Gatling HTTP features. Gatling provides a cloud-hosted web application
[https://ecomm.gatling.io](https://ecomm.gatling.io) for running sample simulations. You'll learn how to construct simulations
using the Java SDK. Code examples for the Kotlin and Scala SDKs are available throughout the Documentation.

### Learn the simulation components

A Gatling simulation consists of the following:

- importing Gatling classes,
- configuring the protocol (commonly HTTP),
- describing a scenario,
- setting up the injection profile (virtual user profile).

The following procedure teaches you to develop the simulation from each constituent component. If you want to skip ahead
and copy the final simulation, jump to [Test execution]({{< ref "#test-execution" >}}). Learn more about simulations in the
[Documentation]({{< ref "/reference/script/core/simulation" >}}).

#### Setup the file

Once you have cloned the Gatling repo, open the project in your integrated development
environment (IDE). Gatling recommends the [IntelliJ community edition](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/).

1. Navigate to and open `java/src/test/java/example/BasicSimulation.java`.
2. Modify the simulation by deleting everything below line 7 `import io.gatling.javaapi.http.*;`.
3. The simulation should now look like the following:

{{< include-code "ScriptingIntro1Sample#setup-the-file" java >}}

#### Extend the `Simulation` class

You must extend Gatling's `Simulation` class to write a script. To extend the `Simulation` class, after the import statements, add:

{{< include-code "ScriptingIntro1Sample#extend-the-simulation-class" java >}}

#### Define the protocol class

Inside the `BasicSimulation` class, add an `HTTP protocol` class. Learn about all of the
`HttpProtocolBuilder` options in the [Documentation]({{< ref "/reference/script/protocols/http/protocol" >}}). For
this example, the `baseUrl` property is hardcoded as the Gatling e-commerce test site, and the `acceptHeader` is set to `application/json`.

{{< include-code "ScriptingIntro2Sample#define-the-protocol-class" java >}}

#### Write the scenario

The next step is to describe the user journey. For a web application, this usually consists of a user arriving at the
application and then a series of interactions with the application. The following scenario performs a get request to `https://api-ecomm.gatling.io/session` to retrieve the current user session.

{{< include-code "ScriptingIntro3Sample#write-the-scenario" java >}}

See the [Documentation]({{< ref "/reference/script/core/scenario" >}}) for the available scenario
components.

#### Define the injection profile

The final component of a Gatling simulation is the injection profile. The injection profile is contained in the `setUp`
block. The following example adds 2 users per second for 60 seconds. See the
[Documentation]({{< ref "/reference/script/core/injection" >}}) for all of the injection profile options.

{{< include-code "ScriptingIntro4Sample#define-the-injection-profile" java >}}

Congrats! You have written your first Gatling simulation. The next step is to learn how to run the simulation locally
and on Gatling Enterprise Cloud.

## Test execution

Now, you should have a completed simulation that looks like the following:

{{< include-code "BasicSimulation#full-example" java >}}

### Run the Simulation on Gatling Enterprise Cloud

You can package, deploy, and run your simulation using one of two approaches, depending on whether you prefer a manual or automated process.

#### Simple Manual Use Case

1. Manually generate the package by executing the following command locally on your developerâ€™s workstation:

   {{< platform-toggle >}}
   Linux/MacOS: ./mvnw gatling:enterprisePackage
   Windows: mvnw.cmd gatling:enterprisePackage
   {{</ platform-toggle >}}

2. The above command will create a packaged **jar** file in your project's **target** directory.

3. From your Gatling Enterprise console, go to **Packages**. Create a new package specifying its name, team that owns it, select your packaged jar file for upload then click **Save**.

4. Go to **Simulations** > **Create a simulation** > **Test as code**. Under **Select a package**, choose the newly created package, then click **Create**.

5. Configure your simulation parameters:
   - Simulation name.
   - Under **Select your package and simulation** > **Simulation**, select your simulation class.
   - Under **Configure your locations**, choose the _Managed_ type and select a location based on your preference.
   - Click **Save and launch**.

#### Advanced Use Case with Automated Deployments (Configuration-as-Code)

Gatling Enterprise Cloud is a feature-rich SaaS platform that is designed for teams and organizations to get the most
out of load testing. With the trial account, you created in the [Prerequisites section]({{< ref "#install-gatling" >}}), you can upload and run your test with advanced configuration, reporting, and collaboration features.

From Gatling 3.11 packaging and running simulations on Gatling Enterprise Cloud is simplified by using [configuration as code]({{< ref "reference/execute/cloud/user/configuration-as-code" >}}). In this tutorial, we only use the default configuration to demonstrate deploying your project. You can learn more about customizing your configuration with our [configuration-as-code guide]({{< ref "guides/config-as-code" >}}).

To deploy and run your simulation on Gatling Enterprise Cloud, use the following procedure:

1. Generate an [API token]({{< ref "/reference/execute/cloud/admin/api-tokens" >}}) with the `Configure` permission in your Gatling Enterprise Cloud account.
2. Add the API token to your current terminal session by replacing `<your-API-token>` with the API token generated in step 1 and running the following command:

   {{< platform-toggle >}}
   Linux/MacOS: export GATLING_ENTERPRISE_API_TOKEN=<your-API-token>
   Windows: set GATLING_ENTERPRISE_API_TOKEN=<your-API-token>
   {{</ platform-toggle >}}

3. Run one of the following two commands according to your needs:

   - To deploy your package **and** start the simulation, run:

     {{< platform-toggle >}}
     Linux/MacOS: ./mvnw gatling:enterpriseStart -Dgatling.enterprise.simulationName="<simulation name>"
     Windows: mvnw.cmd gatling:enterpriseStart -Dgatling.enterprise.simulationName="<simulation name>"
     {{</ platform-toggle >}}

   - To deploy your package without starting a run:

     {{< platform-toggle >}}
     Linux/MacOS: ./mvnw gatling:enterpriseDeploy
     Windows: mvnw.cmd gatling:enterpriseDeploy
     {{</ platform-toggle >}}

Watch the Simulation deploy automatically and generate real-time reports.

### Run the Simulation locally for debugging {{% badge info "Optional" /%}} {#run-the-simulation-locally-for-debugging}

The open-source version of Gatling allows you to run simulations locally, generating load from your computer. Running a
new or modified simulation locally is often useful to ensure it works before launching it on Gatling Enterprise Cloud.
Using the Java SDK, you can launch your test with the following command in the project root directory:

{{< platform-toggle>}}
Linux/MacOS: ./mvnw gatling:test -Dgatling.simulationClass=example.BasicSimulation
Windows: mvnw.cmd gatling:test -Dgatling.simulationClass=example.BasicSimulation
{{</ platform-toggle >}}

When the test has finished, there is an HTML link in the terminal that you can use to access the static report.
