## Server Configuration Changes

In version 2025.20.6, we've decoupled the server configuration from the repository configuration to make the healthcheck endpoint always available.

### What Changed

The server configuration has been moved from `control-plane.repository.server` to `control-plane.server`.

### Migration Guide

#### Old Configuration (pre-2025.20.6)

```hocon
control-plane {
  repository {
    # Repository configuration
    type = "aws"
    bucket = "bucket-name"

    # Server configuration (old location)
    server {
      port = 8080
      bind-address = "0.0.0.0"
      certificate {
        path = "/path/to/certificate.p12"
        password = ${CERTIFICATE_PASSWORD}
      }
    }
  }
}
```

#### New Configuration (2025.20.6+)

```hocon
control-plane {
  # Server configuration (new location)
  server {
    port = 8080
    bind-address = "0.0.0.0"
    certificate {
      path = "/path/to/certificate.p12"
      password = ${CERTIFICATE_PASSWORD}
    }
  }

  repository {
    # Repository configuration
    type = "aws"
    bucket = "bucket-name"
  }
}
```

### Backward Compatibility

While the old configuration path `control-plane.repository.server` is still supported for backward compatibility, it's recommended to migrate to the new `control-plane.server` configuration path for future compatibility.

If both configurations are present, the `control-plane.server` configuration will take precedence.
