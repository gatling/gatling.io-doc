## JMS support migrated to the new Jakarta Messaging API

Gatling has moved to the *Jakarta Messaging* API, meaning we're now built against the new `jakarta.jms` package.
Users requiring to stick with the legacy `javax.jms` package must use an adapter library.

## Compatibility with Python WebSockets

Gatling was not properly handling the `wbits` parameter, causing compatibility issue with WebSocket servers such as the Python implementation.

## Dynamic HTTP proxy credentials

Gatling now supports dynamic per-virtual-user HTTP proxy credentials.
