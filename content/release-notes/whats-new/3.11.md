## HTTP

* [#4514](https://github.com/gatling/gatling/issues/4514): Properly implement HTTPS proxies support, revamp corresponding API

## Bundle

* [#4512](https://github.com/gatling/gatling/issues/4512): Replace the standalone bundle with a Maven based one

## gatling-maven-plugin 4.8.0

* Now require at least Maven 3.6.3.
* Drop the `resourcesFolder` and `configFolder` configuration options; we now always use the test resources folder instead.
* Drop the following parameters for `gatling:recorder` that can only be configured through the GUI or the `recorder.conf` file:
  * `gatling.recorder.encoding`
  * `gatling.recorder.followRedirect`
  * `gatling.recorder.proxyHost`,
  * `gatling.recorder.proxyPort`
  * `gatling.recorder.proxySslPort`
  * `gatling.recorder.simulationsFolder`
* The `gatling:test` goal now runs in interactive mode and suggests the simulation class to launch unless:
  * there's only one Simulation available,
  * or the Simulation class is forced with the `-Dgatling.simulationClass=<FullyQualifiedClassName>` Java System Property,
  * or the non-interactive mode is forced, in which case the task will fail if there is more than 1 simulation available,
  * or it's in batch mode (`-B` Maven option), in which case the task will fail if there is more than 1 simulation available,
  * or the `CI` env var is set to `true`, in which case the task will fail if there is more than 1 simulation available.

## gatling-gradle-plugin 3.11.0

* Drop Simulation classes detection based on file name that must end by "Simulation". Properly detect classes that extend `Simulation`.
* Simulation classes filtering is now based on class name and not file name (these can differ in Kotlin and Scala).
* Introduce a new `gatlingRecorder` task to launch the Recorder.
* The `gatlingRun` task now runs in interactive mode and suggests the simulation class to launch unless:
  * there's only one Simulation available,
  * or the Simulation class is forced with the `--simulation=<FullyQualifiedClassName>` option,
  * or the non-interactive mode is forced with the `--non-interactive` option, in which case the task will fail if there is more than 1 simulation available,
  * or the `CI` env var is set to `true`, in which case the task will fail if there is more than 1 simulation available.
* By default, the `gatlingRun` task no longer runs all the available Simulations in alphabetical order. This feature is achieved with the `--all` option.
* The custom `gatlingRun-<FullyQualifiedClassName>` task has been dropped in favor of the `--simulation` option.
* The `scala` plugin is no longer applied by default; it's up to the user to apply it if they have a Scala project.
* Drop the `gatlingLogback` task, it's up to the user to add a configuration file for logback, as available in the demo projects.
