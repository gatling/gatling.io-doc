## Faking PROXY protocol

`X-Forwarded-For` and `X-Forwarded-Proto` are custom HTTP headers that proxies can use to propagate information about the actual caller.
The [proxy protocol](https://www.haproxy.org/download/1.8/doc/proxy-protocol.txt) is a generalization of this mechanism, not restricted to HTTP.

We're introducing in Gatling 3.13 a feature that lets you emulate the downstream traffic generated from a proxy using this protocol.
We're currently only supporting the version 1 of this protocol.

See the [`proxyProtocolSourceIpV4Address` and `proxyProtocolSourceIpV6Address`]({{< ref "/reference/script/http/protocol#proxy" >}}) for more details.

## Support for JMS properties check

With [`jmsProperty`]({{< ref "/reference/script/jms#check" >}}), you can now perform checks on inbound JMS messages properties.
