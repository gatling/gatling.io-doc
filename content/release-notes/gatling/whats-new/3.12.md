## Dropping Akka

Version 3.12 drops the Akka library. There wasn't an issue with Akka or its open-source fork Pekko, but we were only
using a very small fraction. For Gatling, we only need non-distributed thread-safe singletons, which we achieved with an
Executor, and a Multiple-Producers-Single-Consumer (MPSQ) queue for the actor mailbox.

This is a breaking change for third party plugins. If you are the maintainer of an open-source third party plugin,
please reach out on our [Community Forum](https://community.gatling.io) so we can help you with upgrading.

## Dropping Graphite integration {#dropping-graphite}

Nowadays, real time metrics and dataviz are covered by Gatling Enterprise.

The legacy Graphite integration has been deprecated for quite some time and was no longer documented.

As it was built on top of the Akka I/O API and that we're dropping Akka in this release, we've decided to drop this integration as well. 

## Revamping and adding SDK components to stop an ongoing test {{% badge danger %}}BREAKING CHANGE{{% /badge %}} {#revamping-sdk-components}
 
`Injector` is now `LoadGenerator`. This change is largely for
consistency within the Gatling codebase and with the documentation using load generator. The following error options are
affected: 

| Old name         | New name              |
|------------------|-----------------------|
| `stopInjector`   | `stopLoadGenerator`   |
| `stopInjectorIf` | `stopLoadGeneratorIf` |

A new load generator stop option is available: `crashLoadGenerator`. It is the same as `stopLoadGenerator` except the
exit status is a failure and not a success. 

## Improvement on secure cookies handling

Contribution of Alexander Schwartz, from the Keycloak project. Thanks again!

## Improve Scala 3 compatibility

Gatling now ships an internal fork of quicklens so users can bring their own version, including one for Scala 3.
