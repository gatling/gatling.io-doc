## Core

* [#4486](https://github.com/gatling/gatling/issues/4486), [#4489](https://github.com/gatling/gatling/issues/4489) and [#4492](https://github.com/gatling/gatling/issues/4492) greatly improve the Java and Scala SDKs' usage.

Now, instead of always chaining `ActionBuilder`s and `ChainBuilder`s with the `exec` method, you can now pass a whole sequence at once.

This new syntax greatly reduces the verbosity and the amount of `exec` calls.
It's also more code-formatting friendly and reduces the amount of indentations.

Typically, instead of writing:

{{< include-code "oldExec" java >}}

you can now write:

{{< include-code "newExec" java >}}

Note: the old syntax is of course still valid.

## HTTP

* [#4422](https://github.com/gatling/gatling/issues/4422): Support all OAuth1 signature modes, not just an `Authorization` header

## HTML Reports

* [#4479](https://github.com/gatling/gatling/pull/4479): New Dark theme
