For more detailed release notes, including patch releases, please check the
[milestones on GitHub](https://github.com/gatling/gatling/milestones?state=closed).

Also make sure to check the [upgrade guide]({{< ref "/release-notes/gatling/upgrading/3.14-to-3.15" >}}).

## Executing concurrent HTTP requests

Previously, it was only possible with [resources]({{< ref "/reference/script/http/request/#resources" >}}) to execute concurrent HTTP requests as children of a parent one.

It's now possible with [httpConcurrentRequests]({{< ref "/reference/script/http/request/#httpConcurrentRequests" >}}) to directly define a list of concurrent requests with a parent one.

## Controlling error messages cardinality

In order to limit the cardinality of the error messages generated by failing checks, it's now possible with [logActualValueInError]({{< ref "/concepts/checks#logActualValueInError" >}}) to disable logging the actual value.
