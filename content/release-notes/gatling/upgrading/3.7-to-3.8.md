{{< alert tip >}}
Gatling 3.8 is not binary compatible with previous versions.
Any code compiled with a previous version must be recompiled in order to be executed with Gatling 3.8.
Changes listed below are only about source compatibility changes.

{{< alert tip >}}
We recommend that maven, gradle and sbt users upgrade their plugin version if their current version is lower than the one below:
* maven `io.gatling:gatling-maven-plugin:4.2.0`
* gradle `io.gatling.gradle:3.8.0`
* sbt `io.gatling:gatling-sbt:4.2.0`

## Core

* [#4057](https://github.com/gatling/gatling/issues/4057): When calling `andThen` multiple times, instead of appending to the existing sequential scenarios, it now creates a new sequence that will only start once all the users of the preceding sequence are terminated, children scenarios included.

* [#4226](https://github.com/gatling/gatling/issues/4226): The `feed` override that takes a number of entries now produces arrays instead of translating the keys with an index suffix.

## Gradle

* [#4259](https://github.com/gatling/gatling/issues/4259): The `gatling-maven-plugin` no longer automatically configures the `mavenCentral` repository. You now have to follow the [standard practice](https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/declaring_repositories.html#sub:maven_central) and configure it explicitly. This fixes issues with corporate proxy repositories.
