## JMS support moved from `javax.jms` to `jakarta.jms`

Modern versions of the JMS API, now called *Jakarta Messaging*, now use the `jakarta.jms` package.

If you can upgrade your vendor-specific broker library to a new version that supports the new API, upgrading is just a matter of replacing the `javax.jms` package to `jakarta.jms` in your imports.

If you can't upgrade it and must stick to the old API, please check [JMS protocol documentation]({{< ref "/reference/script/jms#legacy" >}}) for upgrade instructions.

## Gatling gRPC on Gatling Enterprise

Running Gatling gRPC 3.14+ on Gatling Enterprise requires the package to be generated with recent build tool plugins:

* gatling-maven-plugin 4.15.0
* gatling-gradle 3.14.01
* gatling-sbt 4.13.0

The reason is that we're no longer enforcing and shipping protobuf 3 as you could be forcing protobuf 4 that gRPC now supports.

If you want to use Gatling gRPC 3.14 with Gatling Enterprise, you must make sure to upgrade your build tool plugin as well.
