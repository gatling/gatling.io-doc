We recommend that maven, gradle and sbt users upgrade their plugin version if their current version is lower than the one below:
* maven `io.gatling:gatling-maven-plugin:4.2.9`

* sbt `io.gatling:gatling-sbt:4.2.6`

## Core

We've upgraded [Pebble](https://github.com/PebbleTemplates/pebble) to 3.2.0. This release changes the main package from `com.mitchellbosecke` to `io.pebbletemplates`. As a result, if you're using custom Pebble extensions, they must be upgraded too in order to work with Gatling 3.9 and above.
