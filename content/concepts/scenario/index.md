This is the reference of the different components available to write scenarios with Gatling.

## Bootstrapping

`scenario` is the way to bootstrap a new scenario.

{{< include-code "bootstrapping" >}}

You can use any character in the name of the scenario **except** tabulations: **\t**.

## Structure elements

All the components in this section can be either:
* attached to a scenario
* directly created, so they can be passed as parameters, stored in constants, etc
* attached to another component in this section

### Exec

The `exec` method is used to execute an action.
Actions are usually requests (HTTP, WebSocket, JMS, MQTT...) that will be sent during the simulation.
Any action that will be executed will be called with `exec`.

For example, when using the Gatling HTTP module you would write the following line:

{{< include-code "exec" >}}

`exec` can also be passed a [Function]({{< ref "session/functions" >}}).

This can be used for manual debugging or to edit the [Session]({{< ref "session/api#session" >}}), e.g.:

{{< include-code "session-lambda" >}}

{{< alert warning >}}
Those functions are executed in Gatling's shared threads, so you must absolutely avoid performing long blocking operations in there, such as remote API calls.
{{< /alert >}}

{{< alert warning >}}
Remember that the [Gatling DSL components are merely definitions]({{< ref "/reference/glossary#dsl" >}}). They only are effective when chained with other DSL components and ultimately passed to the `setUp`. **In particular, they have no effect when used inside functions.**
{{< /alert >}}

{{< include-code "session-lambda-bad" >}}

### Pause

#### `pause`

When a user sees a page he/she often reads what is shown before choosing to click on another link.
To reproduce this behavior, the pause method is used.

There are several ways to use it.

Fixed pause takes a single parameter:
* `duration`: can be an Int for a duration in seconds, a duration, a Gatling EL String or a function

{{< include-code "pause-fixed" >}}

Uniform random pause takes 2 parameters:
* `min`: can be an Int for a duration in seconds, a duration, a Gatling EL String or a function
* `max`: can be an Int for a duration in seconds, a duration, a Gatling EL String or a function

{{< include-code "pause-uniform" >}}

{{< alert tip >}}
All those methods also have an optional force parameter that overrides the pause type defined in the setUp.
Possible values are the [same ones than for global definition]({{< ref "simulation#global-pause-configuration" >}}).
{{< /alert >}}

#### `pace`

You could want to control how frequently an action is executed, to target *iterations per time* type volumes.
Gatling supports a dedicated type of pause: `pace`, which adjusts its wait time depending on the elapsed time since the virtual user last reached this action.
E.g.:

{{< include-code "pace" >}}

There are several ways to use it.

Fixed pace takes a single parameter:
* `duration`: can be an Int for a duration in seconds, a duration, a Gatling EL String or a function

{{< include-code "pace-fixed" >}}

Uniform random pace takes 2 parameters:
* `min`: can be an Int for a duration in seconds, a duration, a Gatling EL String or a function
* `max`: can be an Int for a duration in seconds, a duration, a Gatling EL String or a function

{{< include-code "pace-uniform" >}}

#### `rendezVous`

In some cases, you may want to run some requests, then pause users until all other users have reached a *rendez-vous point*.

It takes a single parameter:
* `users`: the number of users to wait before lifting the waiting point, an int

{{< include-code "rendezVous" >}}

### Loop statements

{{< alert warning >}}
When using the `counterName` parameter to force the loop index attribute name, be careful to use it in a read-only way.
Otherwise, you might break the Gatling underlying component's internal logic.
{{< /alert >}}

#### `repeat`

Repeat the loop a specified amount of times.

It takes 2 parameters:
* `times`: the number of times to repeat the loop content, can be an int, a Gatling EL String or a function
* `counterName` (optional): the key to store the loop counter in the `Session`, starting at 0

{{< include-code "repeat" >}}

#### `foreach`

Repeat the loop for each element in the specified sequence.

It takes 3 parameters:
* `seq`: the list of elements to iterate over, can be a List, a Gatling EL String or a function
* `elementName`: the key to the current element in the `Session`
* `counterName` (optional): the key to store the loop counter in the `Session`, starting at 0

{{< include-code "foreach" >}}

#### `during`

Iterate over the loop during the specified amount of time.

It takes 3 parameters:
* `duration`: can be an Int for a duration in seconds, a duration, a Gatling EL String or a function
* `counterName` (optional): the key to store the loop counter in the `Session`, starting at 0
* `exitASAP` (optional, default true): if true, the condition will be evaluated for each element inside the loop, possibly causing to exit the loop before reaching the end of the iteration.

{{< include-code "during" >}}

#### `asLongAs`

Iterate over the loop as long as the condition is satisfied.

It takes 3 parameters:
* `condition`: can be a boolean, a Gatling EL String resolving a boolean or a function
* `counterName` (optional): the key to store the loop counter in the `Session`, starting at 0
* `exitASAP` (optional, default true): if true, the condition will be evaluated for each element inside the loop, possibly causing to exit the loop before reaching the end of the iteration.

{{< include-code "asLongAs" >}}

#### `doWhile`

Similar to `asLongAs` but the condition is evaluated after the loop.

It takes 2 parameters:
* `condition` can be a boolean, a Gatling EL String resolving a boolean or a function
* `counterName` (optional): the key to store the loop counter in the `Session`, starting at 0

{{< include-code "doWhile" >}}

#### `asLongAsDuring`

Iterate over the loop as long as the condition is satisfied and the duration hasn't been reached.

It takes 4 parameters:
* `condition` can be a boolean, a Gatling EL String resolving a boolean or a function
* `duration` can be an Int for a duration in seconds, a duration, a Gatling EL String or a function
* `counterName` (optional): the key to store the loop counter in the `Session`, starting at 0
* `exitASAP` (optional, default true). If true, the condition will be evaluated for each element inside the loop, possibly causing to exit the loop before reaching the end of the iteration.

{{< include-code "asLongAsDuring" >}}

#### `doWhileDuring`

Similar to `asLongAsDuring` but the condition is evaluated after the loop.

It takes 3 parameters:
* `condition` can be a boolean, a Gatling EL String resolving a boolean or a function
* `duration` can be an Int for a duration in seconds, a duration, a Gatling EL String or a function
* `counterName` (optional): the key to store the loop counter in the `Session`, starting at 0

{{< include-code "doWhileDuring" >}}

#### `forever`

Iterate over the loop content forever.

{{< include-code "forever" >}}

*counterName* is optional.

### Conditional statements

Gatling's DSL has conditional execution support.

#### `doIf`

Used to execute a specific chain of actions only when some condition is satisfied.

It takes one single parameter:
* `condition` can be a boolean, a Gatling EL String resolving a boolean or a function

{{< include-code "doIf" >}}

#### `doIfEquals`

If your test condition is simply to compare two values, you can simply use `doIfEquals`:

It takes 2 parameters:
* `actual` can be a static value, a Gatling EL String or a function
* `expected` can be a static value, a Gatling EL String or a function

{{< include-code "doIfEquals" >}}

#### `doIfOrElse`

Similar to `doIf`, but with a fallback if the condition evaluates to false.

It takes one single parameter:
* `condition` can be a boolean, a Gatling EL String resolving a boolean or a function

{{< include-code "doIfOrElse" >}}

#### `doIfEqualsOrElse`

Similar to `doIfEquals` but with a fallback if the condition evaluates to false.

It takes 2 parameters:
* `actual` can be a static value, a Gatling EL String or a function
* `expected` can be a static value, a Gatling EL String or a function

{{< include-code "doIfEqualsOrElse" >}}

#### `doSwitch`

Add a switch in the chain. Every possible sub-chain is defined with a key.
Switch is selected through the matching of a key with the evaluation of the passed expression.
If no switch is selected, the switch is bypassed.

{{< include-code "doSwitch" >}}

#### `doSwitchOrElse`

Similar to `doSwitch`, but with a fallback if no switch is selected.

{{< include-code "doSwitchOrElse" >}}

#### `randomSwitch`

`randomSwitch` can be used to emulate simple Markov chains.
Simple means cyclic graphs are not currently supported.

{{< include-code "randomSwitch" >}}

Percentages sum can't exceed 100%.
If sum is less than 100%, users that won't fall into one of the chains will simply exit the switch and continue.
Once users are done with the switch, they simply continue with the rest of the scenario.

{{< alert tip >}}
Percentages should be formatted as following: 50% -> 50, 33.3% -> 33.3 and so on.
{{< /alert >}}

#### `randomSwitchOrElse`

Similar to `randomSwitch`, but with a fallback if no switch is selected (i.e.: random number exceeds percentages sum).

{{< include-code "randomSwitchOrElse" >}}

#### `uniformRandomSwitch`

Similar to `randomSwitch`, but with an uniform distribution amongst chains.

{{< include-code "uniformRandomSwitch" >}}

#### `roundRobinSwitch`

Similar to `randomSwitch`, but dispatch uses a round-robin strategy.

{{< include-code "roundRobinSwitch" >}}

### Errors handling

#### `tryMax`

Any error (a technical exception such as a timeout, or a failed check) in the wrapped chain would cause the virtual user to interrupt and start over from the beginning, up to a maximum number of times.
All requests performed in failing iterations will be logged, including the failing one.

It takes 2 parameters:
* `times`: the maximum number of attempts, an int
* `counterName` (optional): the key to store the loop counter in the `Session`, starting at 0

{{< include-code "tryMax" >}}

#### `exitBlockOnFail`

Similar to tryMax, but without retrying on failure.

{{< include-code "exitBlockOnFail" >}}

#### `exitHere`

Make the user exit the scenario from this point.

{{< include-code "exitHere" >}}

#### `exitHereIf`

Make the user exit the scenario from this point if the condition holds.

It takes one single parameter:
* `condition`: can be a boolean, a Gatling EL String resolving a boolean or a function

{{< include-code "exitHereIf" >}}

#### `exitHereIfFailed`

Make the user exit the scenario from this point if it previously had an error.

{{< include-code "exitHereIfFailed" >}}

#### `stopLoadGenerator` and `crashLoadGenerator`

Make the user exit abruptly stop the load generator.

It takes one single parameter:
* `message`: can be a static String, a Gatling EL String resolving a String or a function, used to log a message

{{< include-code "stopLoadGenerator" >}}

The `crash` flavor causes Gatling to exit with a failure code.

#### `stopLoadGeneratorIf` and `crashLoadGeneratorIf`

Make the user exit abruptly stop the load generator.

It takes 2 parameters:
* `message`: can be a static String, a Gatling EL String resolving a String or a function, used to log a message
* `condition`: can be a boolean, a Gatling EL String resolving a boolean or a function

{{< include-code "stopLoadGeneratorIf" >}}

The `crash` flavor causes Gatling to exit with a failure code.

### Groups

Create a group of requests to model processes or requests in the same page.
Groups can be nested.

{{< include-code "group" >}}

{{< alert warning >}}
Beware that group names mustn't contain commas.
{{< /alert >}}

### Dummy

Create a dummy action that simulation a call to a remote system, with response time, status outcome and session updates.
Typically used when you can't call the actual remote system as part of your load tests while still measuring business processes metrics with groups.

{{< include-code "dummy" >}}
