## Instance specifications

We recommend that you use load generator instances with at least 4 cores.

You might want to tune the `Xmx` JVM options to half of the physical memory.
See `jvm-options` configuration below.
If you don't, the JVM will use a max heap size of 1/4th of the physical memory.

{{< alert warning >}}
Each dedicated machine host must be assigned to a single location and control plane. 
{{< /alert >}}

## Permissions

You can configure private locations with pre-existing servers. 
The control plane will be able to use configured dedicated machines as load generators during your simulations.

The control plane must have access to your dedicated machines. Ensure that each host is reachable through SSH on a specific port.

The control plane possesses a private key for establishing connections, while the corresponding public key is shared and configured on every host in the location.

## System requirements

Dedicated Machines private locations rely on some dependencies.

So, make sure following are available on the location configured hosts:

- `bash` the GNU Project's shell
- [jq](https://jqlang.github.io/jq/download/) a lightweight and flexible command-line JSON processor.
- [curl](https://curl.se/download.html) a command line tool and library for transferring data with URLs
- [Java runtime environment](https://openjdk.org/install/):
  - For Gatling Java and Scala support: OpenJDK 64bits LTS versions: 11, 17 or 21 (see [Gatling prerequisites]({{< ref "/tutorials/oss#java-version" >}}))
  - For Gatling JS and Postman support: either [GraalVM CE](https://github.com/graalvm/graalvm-ce-builds/releases)
    or [Oracle GraalVM](https://www.graalvm.org/downloads/). You need at least GraalVM for JDK 21.0.2, but we recommend
    installing the latest version.
- `~/.ssh/authorized_keys` with control plane public key

## Troubleshooting

This section contains tips for troubleshooting common issues with dedicated machines. 
If you have an issue not covered here, [contact](https://gatling.io/contact) your Sales or Customer Success representative.

### SSH keys

Execute the command `ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -f control-plane` to generate your key pair. _(You have the option to configure a password during this process)_

This will generate the `control-plane` private key and `control-plane.pub` public key in the current directory where the command was executed.

Next, you'll need to configure the authorized keys on the host for a user named, for example, `gatling`.

To configure the authorized keys on the host:

1. Create the authorized_keys file in the gatling/.ssh directory on the host:
  ```bash
  touch gatling/.ssh/authorized_keys
  chmod 600 gatling/.ssh/authorized_keys
  ```

2. Add the public key to gatling/.ssh/authorized_keys on the host. You can do this either by using the ssh-copy-id command:
  ```bash
  ssh-copy-id -i control-plane.pub gatling@host
  ```
  Or, manually by appending the public key to the file with:
  ```bash
  cat control-plane.pub >> gatling/.ssh/authorized_keys
  ```

3. Add the private key to the control plane. Refer to your control plane config file for the expected private key file path: for your location, the value of `ssh.private-key.path`.

### Timeout

If your execution results in a timeout without any additional information, it indicates that the script failed unexpectedly. 
To investigate this issue, you can configure a location to remain active by using the following settings:

```
locations = [
  {
    id = "prl_dedicated"
    type = "dedicated"
    ...
    debug {
      keep-load-generator-alive = true
    }
  }
]
```

Afterward, you can examine the logs via systemd logs using the identifier `gatling` with `journalctl --identifier gatling`.
