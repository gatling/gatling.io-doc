### Understand permissions {#permissions}

There are 8 different user roles and corresponding permission levels in Gatling Enterprise:

Organization-level roles:

- Administrator
- Leader
- Contributor
- Viewer

Team-level roles:

- Team Administrator

The following table details the permissions granted to each role. For team-level roles, the permissions only apply to each team for which the user has permissions:
