{{< alert warning >}}
The gRPC protocol is not supported by Gatling JS.
{{< /alert >}}

## Bootstrapping

The Gatling gRPC DSL is not imported by default.

You have to manually add the following imports:

{{< include-code "imports" java kt scala >}}

## Protocol

Use the `grpc` object in order to create a gRPC protocol.

As with every protocol in Gatling, the gRPC protocol can be configured for a scenario. This is done thanks to the following
statements:

{{< include-code "protocol-configuration" java kt scala >}}

### Target {{% badge danger required /%}} {#target}

The first and only mandatory step is to configure the remote service address and port.

##### `forAddress`

It can be done with either the address as host and port.

{{< include-code "forAddress" java kt scala >}}

##### `forTarget`

Or by using a URL or FDQN with both host and port directly:

{{< include-code "forTarget" java kt scala >}}

### Channel options

By default, every user will use their own gRPC channel to connect to the remote service.

##### `shareChannel`

It is possible to share the same channel for all users by using:

{{< include-code "shareChannel" java kt scala >}}

Be aware that even though the same channel is used for all users, the number of underlying connections used doesn't
scale automatically.

##### `useChannelPool`

Use a pool of gRPC channels, instead of a single channel. This allows opening more underlying HTTP/2 connections.
Useful when using `shareChannel` and when performance is limited by the maximum number of concurrent gRPC streams open
on each connection.

{{< include-code "useChannelPool" java kt scala >}}

### Encryption and authentication

It is possible to use either unencrypted or encrypted connections to a remote service.

##### `usePlaintext`

If you don't want the connection to be encrypted:

{{< include-code "usePlaintext" java kt scala >}}

##### `useInsecureTrustManager` {{% badge info default /%}} {#useinsecuretrustmanager}

If you want to trust all certificates without any verification, you can use an insecure trust manager.
A useful option for self-signed certificates:

{{< include-code "useInsecureTrustManager" java kt scala >}}

This is the default option as it is more performant and validating certificates typically isn't important for load
tests.

##### `useStandardTrustManager`

Finally, you can use the standard trust manager that comes with the JVM:

{{< include-code "useStandardTrustManager" java kt scala >}}

##### `useCustomCertificateTrustManager`

Or use your own certificate:

{{< include-code "useCustomCertificateTrustManager" java kt scala >}}

##### `shareSslContext`

TLS handshake will be performed only once and the TLS sessions will be shared between all the users.
Use this option if you want to avoid the overhead of TLS while still having per-user channels.

{{< include-code "shareSslContext" java kt scala >}}

#### `callCredentials`

You can specify call credentials by providing an instance of `io.grpc.CallCredentials`. This will be applied to each
gRPC call, except when [overridden on specific calls]({{< ref "methods#method-call-credentials" >}}).

{{< include-code "callCredentials" java kt scala >}}

#### `channelCredentials`

You can specify channel credentials by providing an instance of `io.grpc.ChannelCredentials`.

{{< include-code "channelCredentials" java kt scala >}}

This is most often used for mutual auth TLS, for instance:

{{< include-code "tlsMutualAuthChannelCredentials" java kt scala >}}

{{<alert warning>}}
Because `io.grpc.ChannelCredentials` can specify its own trust manager, this option is **not** compatible with the
`useInsecureTrustManager`, `useStandardTrustManager`, or `useCustomCertificateTrustManager` options.

To avoid the overhead of validating the server certificate, you can explicitly build your channel credentials with an
insecure trust manager, for instance:

{{< include-code "insecureTrustManagerChannelCredentials" java kt scala >}}
{{< /alert >}}

#### `overrideAuthority`

You can override the authority used with TLS and HTTP virtual hosting.

{{< include-code "overrideAuthority" java kt scala >}}

### Headers

Define gRPC headers to be set on all requests. Note that keys in gRPC headers are allowed to be associated with more
than one value, so adding the same key a second time will simply add a second value, not replace the first one.

###### `asciiHeader`

Shortcut for a single [header]({{< ref "#header" >}}) with the default ASCII marshaller, i.e.
`io.grpc.Metadata#ASCII_STRING_MARSHALLER`:

{{< include-code "asciiHeader" java kt scala >}}

###### `asciiHeaders`

Shortcut for multiple [headers]({{< ref "#header" >}}) with the default ASCII marshaller as a map of multiple key and
value pairs, i.e. `io.grpc.Metadata#ASCII_STRING_MARSHALLER`:

{{< include-code "asciiHeaders" java kt scala >}}

###### `binaryHeader`

Shortcut for a single [header]({{< ref "#header" >}}) with the default binary marshaller, i.e.
`io.grpc.Metadata#BINARY_BYTE_MARSHALLER`:

{{< include-code "binaryHeader" java kt scala >}}

###### `binaryHeaders`

Shortcut for multiple [headers]({{< ref "#header" >}}) with the default binary marshaller as a map of multiple key and
pairs, i.e. `io.grpc.Metadata#BINARY_BYTE_MARSHALLER`:

{{< include-code "binaryHeaders" java kt scala >}}

##### `header`

Add a single header with a custom key.

{{< include-code "header" java kt scala >}}

### Loading balancing

When the name resolver returns a list of several service IP addresses, you probably want to configure a load balancing
policy. The policy is responsible for maintaining connections to the services and picking a connection to use each time
a request is sent.

##### `useCustomLoadBalancingPolicy`

Use a [custom load balancing](https://grpc.io/docs/guides/custom-load-balancing/) by name:

{{< include-code "useCustomLoadBalancingPolicy" java kt scala >}}

Or with JSON configuration:

{{< include-code "useCustomLoadBalancingPolicy2" java kt scala >}}

Check the [gRPC documentation](https://grpc.io/docs/guides/custom-load-balancing/) for more details.

##### `usePickFirstLoadBalancingPolicy`

This policy actually does no load balancing but just tries each address it gets from the name resolver and uses the
first one it can connect to:

{{< include-code "usePickFirstLoadBalancingPolicy" java kt scala >}}

##### `usePickRandomLoadBalancingPolicy`

Randomly pick an address from the name resolver: 

{{< include-code "usePickRandomLoadBalancingPolicy" java kt scala >}}

This load balancing policy is bundled with Gatling gRPC but not a standard of gRPC.

##### `useRoundRobinLoadBalancingPolicy`

Round-robin load balancing over the addresses returned by the name resolver:

{{< include-code "useRoundRobinLoadBalancingPolicy" java kt scala >}}
