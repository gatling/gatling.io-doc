WebSocket support was initially contributed by [Andrew Duffy](https://github.com/amjjd).

WebSocket support is an extension to the HTTP DSL, whose entry point is the `ws` method.

WebSocket protocol is very different from the HTTP one as the communication is 2 ways: both client-to-server and server-to-client, so the model is different from the HTTP request/response pair.

As a consequence, the main HTTP branch and a WebSocket branch can exist in a Gatling scenario in a dissociated way, in parallel.
When doing so, each flow branch has its own state, so a user might have to reconcile them, for example when capturing data from a WebSocket check and wanting this data to be available to the HTTP branch.

## `wsName`

If you want to deal with several WebSockets per virtual users, you have to give them a name and pass this name on each ws operation:

{{< include-code "wsName" java kt scala >}}

If you set an explicit name for the WebSocket, you'll have to make it explicit for every other WebSocket actions you'll define later in the scenario.

Of course, this step is not required if you deal with one single WebSocket per virtual user.

## `connect`

The first thing is to connect a WebSocket:

{{< include-code "wsConnect" java kt scala >}}

You can specify a subprotocol:

{{< include-code "subprotocol" java kt scala >}}

You can define a chain of actions to be performed after (re-)connecting with `onConnected`:

{{< include-code "onConnected" java kt scala >}}

## `close`

Once you're done with a WebSocket, you can close it:

{{< include-code "close" java kt scala >}}

## Send a message

You may send text or binary messages:

* `sendText(text: Expression[String])`
* `sendBytes(bytes: Expression[Array[Byte]])`

For example:

{{< include-code "send" java kt scala >}}

Note that:

* `ElFileBody`, `PebbleStringBody` and `PebbleFileBody` can be used with `sendText`
* `RawFileBody` and `ByteArrayBody` can be used with `sendBytes`.

See [HTTP request body]({{< ref "http/request#request-body" >}}) for more information.

## Checks

Gatling currently only supports blocking checks that will wait until receiving expected message or timing out.

### Set a check

You can set a check right after connecting:

{{< include-code "check-from-connect" java kt scala >}}

Or you can set a check right after sending a message to the server:

{{< include-code "check-from-message" java kt scala >}}

You can set multiple checks sequentially. Each one will expect one single frame.

You can configure multiple checks in a single sequence:

{{< include-code "check-single-sequence" java kt scala >}}

You can also configure multiple check sequences with different timeouts:

{{< include-code "check-multiple-sequence" java kt scala >}}

### Create a check

You can create checks for text and binary frames with `checkTextMessage` and `checkBinaryMessage`.
You can use almost all the same check criteria as for HTTP requests.

{{< include-code "create-single-check" java kt scala >}}

You can have multiple criteria for a given message:

{{< include-code "create-multiple-checks" java kt scala >}}

checks can be marked as `silent`.
Silent checks won't be reported whatever their outcome.

{{< include-code "silent-check" java kt scala >}}

### Matching messages

You can define `matching` criteria to filter messages you want to check.
Matching criterion is a standard check, except it doesn't take `saveAs`.
Non-matching messages will be ignored.

{{< include-code "matching" java kt scala >}}

## Processing unmatched messages

You can use `processUnmatchedMessages` to process inbound messages that haven't been matched with a check and have been buffered.
By default, unmatched inbound messages are not buffered, you must enable this feature by setting the size of the buffer on the protocol with `.wsUnmatchedInboundMessageQueueSize(maxSize)`.
The buffer is reset when:
* sending an outbound message 
* calling `processUnmatchedMessages` so we don't present the same message twice

You can then pass your processing logic as a function.
The list of messages passed to this function is sorted in timestamp ascending (meaning older messages first).
It contains instances of types `io.gatling.http.action.ws.WsInboundMessage.Text` and `io.gatling.http.action.ws.WsInboundMessage.Binary`.

{{< include-code "process" java kt scala >}}

## Configuration

WebSocket support introduces new HttpProtocol parameters:

{{< include-code "protocol" java kt scala >}}

## Debugging

You can inspect WebSocket traffic if you add the following logger to your logback configuration:

```xml
<logger name="io.gatling.http.action.ws.fsm" level="DEBUG" />
```

## Example

Here's an example that runs against [Play 2.2](https://www.playframework.com/download#older-versions)'s chatroom sample (beware that this sample is missing from Play 2.3 and above):
