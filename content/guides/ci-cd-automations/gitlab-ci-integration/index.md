Performance testing is a critical component of modern software development. By integrating Gatling Enterprise with Gitlab CI/CD, you incorporate performance testing into your development workflow, ensuring your applications meet performance standards before reaching production.

## Prerequisites

- Gatling version `{{< var gatlingVersion >}}` or higher
- An account on Gatling Entreprise
- Clone [this code](https://github.com/gatling/devrel-projects) and cd into the `articles/gitlabintegration` folder.

## Test Creation

### Create the Scenario

Let's create a simple scenario that loads our [e-commerce demo website](https://ecomm.gatling.io/).

{{< include-code "ecommerce#ecommerce-example" ts java scala kt>}}

### Generate the user and assertions

We start with a single user to verify our simulation works correctly. Then we add assertions to validate our test results. In this example, we check that more than 90% of requests are successful.

## Gatling Enterprise

### Deploy to Gatling Enterprise

Now that we have our test ready, we need to deploy the package to Gatling Enterprise.

While this video demonstrates the JavaScript SDK specifically, the deployment process remains identical across all Gatling SDKs and CI/CD platforms we support.

### Create the Simulation

{{< alert info >}}
This step is applicable to all CI/CD platforms supported by Gatling Enterprise.

Next, we create a simulation in Gatling Enterprise using our deployed package.

### Copy Your Simulation ID

Make sure to copy the `simulation Id` by clicking the three dots menu next to your simulation name, as we use this ID in subsequent steps.

### Create an API Key

{{< alert info >}}
This step is applicable to all CI/CD platforms supported by Gatling Enterprise.
{{< /alert >}}

To enable Gitlab CI/CD to interact with Gatling Enterprise and trigger simulations, you need to generate an API key.

With Gatling Enterprise configured, we proceed to setting up our Gitlab CI/CD pipeline.

## Gitlab CI/CD

### Set up the Secrets and Environment

To run simulations from Gitlab CI/CD, you first need to configure a secure API token. Follow these steps to set up the required variable:

1. Navigate to your GitLab repository
2. Access the `Settings` menu
3. Select `CI/CD` from the sidebar
4. Click on `Variables`
5. Press the `Add variable` button
6. Choose `Masked and hidden` for `Visibility`
7. Enter `GATLING_ENTERPRISE_API_TOKEN` as the `Key`
8. Paste your API token as the `Value`

If you need to generate a new API token, follow our guide [here]({{< ref "/reference/collaborate/admin/api-tokens" >}}).

### Configure the Pipeline

Let's set up a basic Gitlab CI/CD pipeline that runs your performance tests. The pipeline configuration triggers a simulation using the provided **`simulation Id`**.

Here's the pipeline configuration (.gitlab-ci.yml):

```yaml
stages:
  - load-test

run-gatling-enterprise:
  stage: load-test
  image:
    name: gatlingcorp/enterprise-runner:1
    entrypoint: ['']
  script:
    - gatlingEnterpriseStart
  variables:
    # We assume GATLING_ENTERPRISE_API_TOKEN is available,
    # e.g. configured on the GitLab project
    # Specify your simulation ID:
    SIMULATION_ID: '00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000'
```

For advanced pipeline customization options, check our [Gitlab CI/CD documentation]({{< ref "/integrations/ci-cd/gitlab-ci" >}}).

### Run the Pipeline

With everything configured, you can now trigger the pipeline from GitLab CI/CD. Provide your **`simulation Id`** when running the pipeline, and you are able to monitor the test execution both in GitLab and Gatling Enterprise.

## Conclusion

This integration streamlines the testing process and enhances collaboration between development teams. With Gatling Enterprise and Gitlab CI/CD, you create a pipeline that continuously monitors your application's performance, making it easier to maintain high standards of application quality throughout the development lifecycle.
