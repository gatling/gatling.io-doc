## Highlights

Gatling Enterprise Edition 1.18 introduces Gatling 3.9 support and a redesign of the PDF export feature.

### Gatling 3.9 Support

Gatling 3.9 is the latest generation of Gatling. Just like every new minor release, it's not binary compatible with previous releases, so code already compiled must be recompiled in order to upgrade.

### Java 17 Upgrade

Gatling Enterprise Edition now supports running on Java 17.
Docker, AWS MarketPlace and Azure MarketPlace images have been upgraded to run with Java 17.
This lets users easily compile Gatling code using modern Java APIs.

### Kubernetes Support Revamping

First, we've dropped the legacy NodePort connection mode that was both considered unsecured and against Kubernetes principles.

If you're still using pools with the "Node Port" mode, you must first move to another one prior to upgrading.

Then, we've revamped the way the Gatling Enterprise Edition controller connects to Load Generators.
When they sit in the same cluster, we now always create a Service. In this case, the Ingress and Route modes are not available.

Finally, we now support setting ingressClassName, tolerations, annotations and container env vars.

### 1.18.3 (2023-04-03) {#1.18.3}

{{< alert warning >}}
If you run the Gatling Enterprise Edition server in Docker (including Kubernetes) with the default user: you will need to change the owner of your private key files. This is because the default user for the `gatlingcorp/frontline` container is no longer the root user (it now defaults to the `uid:gid` of `1001:0`).

You have nothing to do if:

- you already explicitly override the user (e.g. by using the `user` key in Docker Compose, or the `runAsUser` directive in Kubernetes)
- you run Gatling Enterprise Edition on OpenShift with the default user settings (OpenShift already overrides the user by default)

Otherwise, you need to change the ownership of:

- your private key files, mounted to `/opt/frontline/keys` in the container
- your configuration files, mounted to `/opt/frontline/conf` in the container
- any other files that Gatling Enterprise Edition needs write access to

```bash
chown -R 1001:0 <list of files or folders>
```

As the main user is no longer `root`, some other mount paths might need to be changed too. For example, AWS credentials previously mounted to `/root/.aws` should now be mounted to `/opt/frontline/.aws`.
