##### Fixes

### 1.9.0 (2019-10-23)

#### Gatling 3.3.0

{{< alert warning >}}
Gatling 3.3.0 is source compatible but not fully binary compatible with the 3.2 series.
In particular, `incrementUsersPerSec` and `incrementConcurrentUsers` are not compiled the same way.
As a consequence, we recommend that you upgrade Gatling version in your projects' configuration and
recompile your pre-packaged binaries. Otherwise, tests might fail with `NoSuchMethodError` on injector boot.
{{< /alert >}}

See full release note: https://github.com/gatling/gatling/milestone/90?closed=1

#### Gatling Enterprise Edition

{{< alert warning >}}
This release introduce a major change in the way sources and binaries repositories and configured so such configuration is no longer duplicated in all your simulations.
Existing simulations will be automatically migrated when updating Gatling Enterprise Edition instance.
Please remember to make a Cassandra database backup before upgrading.
