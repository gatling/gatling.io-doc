## Highlights

Gatling Enterprise Edition 1.19 introduces Gatling 3.10 and Java 21 support and requires running at least on Java 11.

### Java 11 Baseline

{{< alert warning >}}
Starting from this release, Gatling Enterprise Edition requires at least Java 11.

If you're still running the Gatling Enterprise Edition server or your Load Generators with an older version such as Java 8,
you must first upgrade these installations prior to upgrading to Gatling Enterprise Edition 1.19.0.

### Gatling 3.3 and 3.4 Support Planned for Removal

{{< alert warning >}}
Support for Gatling 3.3 and 3.4 is planned for removal in an upcoming release.

We recommend that you upgrade your tests to Gatling 3.10.0, older versions are no longer maintained.

### Docker images default user change

{{< alert warning >}}
If you run the Gatling Enterprise Edition server in Docker (including Kubernetes) and are upgrading directly from a version older than 1.18.3, please note that the default user for our Docker image changed in release 1.18.3.

In that case, make sure to refer to the instructions in the [1.18.3 release notes]({{< ref "1.18#1.18.3" >}}).
{{< /alert >}}

### Gatling 3.10 Support

Gatling 3.10 is the latest generation of Gatling.
Just like every new minor release, it's not binary compatible with previous releases, so code already compiled must be recompiled in order to upgrade.

### Java 21 Support

Gatling Enterprise Edition now supports running on Java 21.
Docker, AWS MarketPlace and Azure MarketPlace images have been upgraded to run with Java 21.
This lets users easily use modern Java APIs in their Gatling tests.
