## Highlights

### Gatling 3.3 and 3.4 support removed

{{< alert warning >}}
As previously announced, Gatling 3.3 and 3.4 have reached end of life and have stopped being supported in Gatling Enterprise Edition.
{{< /alert >}}

### Required Load Generator JVM option

{{< alert warning >}}
If your Load Generators are running with Java 11 or higher, you must add the extra JVM option `--add-opens=java.base/java.lang=ALL-UNNAMED`.
Sadly, this is not something we can do automatically as we don't know your Java version beforehand.
We recommend that you do this once in the [Global Properties]({{< ref "../execute/simulations#global-properties" >}}).
