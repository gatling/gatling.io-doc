{{< /alert >}}

## Gatling Enterprise Edition 1.14

Gatling Enterprise Edition 1.14 introduce support for multiple versions of Gatling and performance fixes.

### Gatling 3.6, 3.5, 3.4 and 3.3 generations support

Gatling Enterprise Edition 1.14 is compatible with the 4 latest Gatling generations.

{{< alert tip >}}
Only Gatling 3.6 will be actively maintained.
Multiple versions support is for convenience so that customers don't have to upgrade all their tests when upgrading their Gatling Enterprise Edition platform.
Customers are recommended to upgrade to Gatling 3.6 as soon as they can.

### Key New Features

* faster crash when a simulation can't be instantiated because of a user error (no more HTTP retries in this case)
* AWS subnets are no multivalued and retried randomly if deploying the pool fails because of insufficient capacity
* full Cassandra Java Driver configuration with Typesafe config (eg configuring TSL)
* the Gatling zip bundle now provides a script to generate uploadable artifacts (eg in an S3 bucket repository)

### Key Bug Fixes

* several bug fixes related to group menu in Requests and Groups tabs
* updating a filesystem private key didn't properly update the path
* TCP Connection states stats were missing when network was IPv6 while target was IPv4

## Gatling 3.6.0

{{< alert tip >}}
Gatling 3.6 becomes the production version, meaning that no further improvements and bug fixes will happen on Gatling 3.5.

### Key New Features
