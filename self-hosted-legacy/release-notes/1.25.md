## Highlights

### Security issues fixes

This release fixes several important security issues.

We highly recommend our customers to upgrade.

#### Session invalidation

In several cases, sessions were not properly invalidated, and it was possible to save a session cookie and manually re-inject it in subsequent requests to be granted access.

Session cookies were not properly revoked in the following situations:
  * expiration when the maximum session duration is reached as per `cookieMaxAge` in `frontline.conf` (default: 8 days)
  * permissions modifications by an admin
  * logout
  * server reboot
  * new log in with the same account

This release now properly invalidate session cookies in the above situations.

#### ACL on teams list in the admin menu

It was possible to call the `/api/private/teams` private API in read-only while being connected with a user who only has the `Viewer` or `Tester` role.

#### ACL on repositories list in the admin menu

It was possible to call the `/api/private/repositories` private API in read-only while being connected with a user who only has the `Viewer` or `Tester` role.
